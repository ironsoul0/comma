#### Day 1 [Sunday, December 30].

1. _01:34_ -- Created a log file.
2. _01:37_ -- Tried to find API docs of **chffr** on Comma.ai website and at comma community wiki. No luck.
3. _01:40_ -- Looking inside comma's public github repos. Found two directly related to **chffr** repos:
   . [chffrplus](https://github.com/commaai/chffrplus)
   . [chffr-api](https://github.com/commaai/chffr-api)
4. _01:47_ -- Examined JSON files. Each data appears to contain only _5_ fields I need. Thus, no need to look for API docs anymore.
5. _03:00_ -- Played around / experimented a bit with the **chffrr** repo and modified some parts to get what's now inside _experiments_ folder.
6. _03:11_ -- Can display info about a single route from JSONs. (Design sucks though)
